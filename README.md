# LambdaConf Haskell Hackathon 2018

On June 6, 2018, I'll (Michael Snoyman) be running a Haskell Hackathon
as a Mini-Conf after LambdaConf. If you're interested in interacting
with other Haskellers, helping improve code or docs on Haskell
projects, or mentoring other Haskellers, please consider joining in.

The purpose of this repository is to help collect work items that
people at a Hackathon can contribute to. This is a great way to try
and get new people involved in your project, so I highly encourage
people to participate. Also, if all goes well, I intend to keep
running this repository after the LambdaConf conference for other
Hackathons, both in-person and virtual.
